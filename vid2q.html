        <p>The movie talks about how artificial intelligence (AI) has been used to make healthcare better. For example, AI has been used to make a system that can find cancer cells, a system that can personalize treatment plans, and a system that can help with mental health. All of these methods are impressive, but there are many ways to make them even better.
            Making these tools more accurate and reliable is one way to make them better. This can be done by using more advanced machine learning methods and training the systems on bigger data sets.
            Another way to make these tools better is to make them easier to use and cheaper. This can be done by coming up with ways to use the systems in places with few resources and by making the systems easier to use.
            Last but not least, we can make these processes better by making them more open and accountable. This means making it easy for people to understand how the systems work and see how decisions are made. This would help make sure that these systems don't make choices that are biased or unfair.</p>
        <p>Here are some specific ways we can improve, upgrade, and come up with new ideas for the tools shown in the video:</p>
        <div>
            <li>The method that makes music could be better if it was more creative and original. This could be done by giving the system more freedom to try and training it on a wider range of music styles.</li>
            <li>The method for diagnosing diseases could be made better if it was more accurate and dependable. This could be done by giving the system more medical images to learn from and using more powerful machine learning methods.</li>
            <li>The method for making new limbs could be improved by making it cheaper and easier to use. This could be done by using cheaper materials and making the process of making the product easier.</li>
        </div>
        <p>These are just a few ideas. There are many more ways to make the systems shown in the movie better, more innovative, and more advanced. As AI keeps getting better, we need to stay ahead of the curve and make sure these systems are used for good.</p>
