        <p>The idea that AI might be able to understand and feel human feelings like empathy and loneliness is something that continues to fascinate and push our ideas about the role of technology in our lives. Matt McMullen, a creator from California, and Guile Lindroth, who was one of the first people to make personal assistant software, have started a journey to make AI partners that can make users feel connected and at ease. Their AI friend lives in a computer and uses cutting-edge technologies like machine learning, voice recognition, and chatbots to have talks that feel like they are with a real person. What's the end goal? To make an artificial intelligence system that can talk like a person.</p>
        <p>Pedro Domingos goes deeper into what AI can do, especially in cases where people might not be able to tell them apart from other people. Microsoft's softbot Xiaoice has already been used by more than 100 million people. It can have emotional conversations with people, which could fill in where human ties fall short. These changes raise deep questions about how people connect, talk to each other, and even love.</p>
        <p>As a robotics engineer, Matt McMullen has done amazing work on a next-generation doll with a vision system that can handle complex visual cues. This robot has cameras in its eyes so it can read and understand human feelings. It does this by taking advantage of the fact that 90% of human communication is nonverbal, mostly through facial expressions. McMullen imagines a world where AI-powered devices and robots become more like people. This would push the limits of how people interact with robots and how much we value relationships.</p>
        <p>A film director named Oscar Sharp talks about how AI can help with scriptwriting. He talks about his experiences with scripts written by AI and stresses how important human contact is for making robots that seem real. Sharp and Ross Goodwin made Benjamin, the AI tool that writes scripts, which is a deep learning language model. It looks at the scripts of thousands of popular Hollywood movies and comes up with new stories and action descriptions. Critics have praised Benjamin's ability to come up with interesting stories, which shows how AI and human imagination can work together.</p>
        <p>The talk focuses on the fact that AI's purpose is not to replace human skills, but to improve them so that people can be more creative than they could be on their own. AI can read and understand texts, mine human events for material, and help with art projects. In this process, it's important to be able to understand how people feel and think, and AI has the potential to figure out not only feelings like love and creativity but also other human traits.</p>
        <p>With the world's first AI racing, the British company Roborace is pushing the limits of technology and safety in the field of self-driving cars. Roborace wants to show how self-driving cars could work on a racetrack by combining technologies like differential GPS, LiDAR sensors, and vehicle-to-vehicle contact. Teams like Testing RoboRace and Arrival run tests that show how AI can make choices and push the limits of control, traction, and throttle. These changes show hope for the future of road technology and could make our roads safer and cleaner in the future.</p>
        <p>But as AI keeps getting better, there are still questions about the hard problem of consciousness and whether robots can really copy human traits. Some people think that evolution will make AI more human-like, while others say that the core of what it means to be human is still a secret. The future of AI is still unclear, and these moral questions make it hard to understand how technology and people are connected.</p>
