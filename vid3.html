        <p>The documentary looks at how artificial intelligence (AI) might help humans improve their skills and get around their physical limits. It has talks with scientists, engineers, and athletes who are using AI to make new technologies that can make us stronger, faster, and smarter.
            One of the most interesting ways AI could be used in this area is to make bionic arms. Bionic limbs are prosthetics that the person wearing them can move with their thoughts. People who have been hurt or disabled can use them to get back some of the functions they have lost.
            Exoskeletons are also being made with the help of AI. Exoskeletons are robots that you can wear and that can give you more strength and movement. Soldiers, firefighters, and other workers who have to lift big things or do hard jobs can use them.
            AI is also being used to improve our mental skills, in addition to making us stronger physically. For instance, brain-computer interfaces that are powered by AI can be used to help people with disabilities talk and control equipment. AI is also used to come up with new ways to learn and remember things.
            The program also talks about the ethical issues that come up when AI is used to make people smarter. One worry is that AI could be used to make "superhumans" who are smarter and better than the rest of us. A second worry is that AI could be used to make weapons that could hurt or kill people.
            Overall, the program gives a balanced look at the pros and cons of using AI to improve people's skills. Anyone who wants to know what will happen to people in the future should watch it.</p>
        <p>Here are some of my thoughts about the youtube video:</p>
        <div>
            <li>I'm excited about how AI could help us get better at both physical and mental tasks. But I also know there are social problems that need to be solved.</li>
            <li>I think AI has the ability to make us stronger and more able. But it is important to make sure AI is used for good, not bad.</li>
            <li>I'm worried that AI could lead to a new group of "superhumans." This could make the gap between the rich and the poor bigger and also cause trouble in society.</li>
        </div>
        <p>Overall, I think the video is a good addition to the conversation about the future of AI and how we can improve ourselves. It is an interesting and thought-provoking movie that brings up important questions about the moral and social effects of this technology.
            I'd like to add to what the documentary said by saying that AI has the ability to help us solve some of the problems we face as a society. AI can be used to find new ways to treat diseases, slow down climate change, and stop wars, among other things.
            AI has the ability to make the world a better place, in my opinion. But it's important to use this technology in a moral and responsible way. We need to make sure that AI is used to help everyone, not just a small group of people.
            I can't wait to see how AI keeps getting better over the years. I think it has the power to make the world a better place, but it's up to us to make sure that happens.</p>
