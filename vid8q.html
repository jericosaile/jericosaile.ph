    <h1 class="m-4">what will you improve/innovate/upgrade from the system developed?</h1>

      <p>First, in the field of space research, where scientists create an incredible 54 terabytes of data every day, it's very important to improve the way data is processed. AI lets us see patterns and assume that smart technologists are behind the data. Improving AI algorithms to make pattern detection even more nuanced could give us deeper insights. Also, the Allen Telescope Array (A.T.A.) is a powerful way to look for life beyond Earth because it has a bigger field of view and can pick up more frequencies. A big change that could be made to this system would be to make it more sensitive to weak messages from far away. Investing in cutting-edge AI models that can find more subtle patterns in these signals may help us find contact between celestial bodies more easily.</p>
      <p>Second, the huge amount of data collected in the search for life beyond Earth is like the oceans on Earth and is bigger than what standard software can handle. To make AI more useful, it is important to keep improving its machine learning models and methods. AI must become even more adept at learning and building understanding independently. In the Trappist-1 system, where the search for life is getting more serious, improving AI's ability to study communication patterns and spot deviations from normal behavior could be very important. This would make it easier to look for possible signs of alien intelligence in this interesting system of planets.</p>
      <p>Sanctuary A.I., which is run by Suzanne Gildert, is working on making synthetic people. This is a new frontier that has a lot of room for innovation. A big improvement could come from making synthetic humans that are physically, mentally, and emotionally indistinguishable from their biological peers. The next step could be to try to make these synthetics even more complicated and real in how they work and how they act. This would be in line with the goal of making an actual Turing test that really tests our ability to tell the difference between people and machines controlled by AI.</p>
      <p>Also, in the quest to make machines that see and interact with the world like people do, there is still room for improvement in making their awareness and memories more powerful. This means giving them more than just information or skills; it also means giving them the ability to make their own memories from events, which improves their cognitive abilities. If this goal is reached, it could be a big step forward in the growth of AI.</p>
      <p>Lastly, as AI's part grows and it becomes more important in our lives, it's important to keep ethics in mind. It is important to strengthen social rules and enforce best practices for AI, especially in technologies that directly affect people's lives. A 10- to 20-year plan is needed to make sure that AI protects the rights of robots and follows ethical rules. This ethical aspect of AI creation is important to make sure that there aren't any unintended consequences or moral dilemmas.</p>
