        <p>The video talks about a few AI-based systems, such as a system that can make songs, a system that can diagnose diseases, and a system that can make new limbs for amputees. All of these methods are impressive, but there are many ways to make them even better.</p>
        <p>Making these processes more open and accountable is one way to make them better. This means making it easy to see how they work and how they decide what to do. This would help make sure that these systems don't make choices that are biased or unfair.</p>
        <p>Lastly, we can make these processes better by making them easier for everyone to use and benefit from. This means coming up with ways to make them cheaper and giving people training and help so they can use them. This would make sure that everyone can use AI to their advantage.</p>
        <p>Here are some specific ways we can improve, upgrade, and come up with new ideas for the tools shown in the video:</p>
        <div>
            <li>A bigger set of cancer cells could be used to train the system to be more accurate at finding cancer.</li>
            <li>The method for personalizing treatment could be made better by making it more patient-specific by taking into account things like age, genetics, and medical history.</li>
            <li>The mental health support system could be made better by making it easier to use. This could be done by making it available online and teaching mental health workers how to use it.

            </li>
        </div>
        <p>These are just a few ideas. There are many more ways to make the systems shown in the movie better, more innovative, and more advanced. As AI keeps getting better, we need to stay ahead of the curve and make sure that these systems are used to improve everyone's health care.
            In addition to the specific ways listed above, there are also some more general ways to improve the development and use of AI in healthcare. For example, we can make ethical rules for the creation and use of AI in healthcare, and we can teach healthcare professionals about the risks and benefits of AI. By taking these steps, we can help make sure that AI is used to improve health care in a safe and effective way.</p>
