        <p>The documentary looks at how artificial intelligence (AI) could change the way health is done. It has interviews with doctors, scientists, and patients who are using AI to come up with new treatments and improve the level of care.</p>
        <p>One of the most promising ways that AI can be used in health is to find cancer. Algorithms that are powered by AI can now examine medical images more accurately than human radiologists can. This has led to cancer being found earlier, which can help people have a better chance of living.</p>
        <p>AI is also used to come up with new medicines and treatments. One company, for example, is using AI to create molecules that go straight to cancer cells. This could lead to treatments that work better and are less dangerous.</p>
        <p>AI is also being used to treat a number of other diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and diabetes, in addition to cancer. Systems that are driven by AI can be used to check on the health of patients and come up with personalized treatment plans.</p>
        <p>The documentary also talks about how using AI in health affects morals. One worry is that AI could be used to treat some people less well than others. For instance, an AI algorithm that is trained on data from a community that is mostly white might not work well for people of color.</p>
        <p>Another worry is that AI could be used to make guns that kill themselves without any help from a person. This is a very important moral question that needs to be thought about carefully.</p>
        <p>Overall, the program gives an even look at the pros and cons of using AI in medicine. Anyone who is interested in the future of health care needs to watch it.</p>
        <p>Here are some of my thoughts about the film:</p>
        <div>
            <li>AI has the ability to make it easier to find out what's wrong with someone and treat them. But I also know there are social problems that need to be solved.</li>
            <li>I think AI has the ability to make healthcare more fair and easy to get for everyone. But it's important to make sure that AI systems don't favor certain groups of people over others.</li>
            <li>I'm worried that AI could be used to make tools that can fight for themselves. This is a very important moral question that needs to be thought about carefully.</li>
        </div>
        <p>Overall, I think the video adds something important to the conversation about the future of AI in medicine. It is an interesting and thought-provoking movie that brings up important questions about the moral and social effects of this technology.</p>
        <p>I would like to add to what the documentary said by saying that AI has the ability to change the way we think about health and wellness. AI-powered chatbots, for example, can be used to give personalized health tips and help. AI can also be used to make virtual reality and augmented reality experiences that can be used to train doctors and nurses or help patients handle their chronic conditions.</p>
        <p>There are so many things that could be done, and I'm excited to see how AI will continue to change medicine in the future.</p>
