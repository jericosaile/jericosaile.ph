        <p>The video looks at the pros and cons of artificial intelligence also known as AI. It has interviews with experts in the field, like William and Mark Sagar, who talk about the chance of AI becoming sentient or even conscious. They also talk about how AI could be used for bad things, like making weapons that can fight themselves or controlling people's feelings.</p>
        <p>Some important questions about the future of AI are brought up in the movie. How far do you think we should go with AI? What are the risks of making artificial intelligence that is smarter than humans? How can we make sure that artificial intelligence is used for good and not bad?</p>
        <p>I think the movie does a good job of showing how AI can be seen from different points of view. "How far is too far?" is a question that can't be easily answered. But the movie is a good way to start talking about these important topics.</p>
        <p>Here are some of the things I think about it:</p>
        <div>
            <li>AI has the ability to be a powerful force for good in the world, in my opinion. Some of the most important problems in the world, like climate change, poverty, and sickness, can be solved with it.</li>
            <li>AI can be used to find more efficient ways to make energy, come up with new medical treatments, and make better transportation systems, among other things.</li>
            <li>But I also think that AI has risks. AI could be used to hurt people or even destroy the world if it is not used properly.</li>
            <li>AI could be used, for example, to make guns that can kill without any help from a person.</li>
            <li>It could also be used to get people to feel a certain way or share false information.</li>
            <li>It's important to talk about the future of AI with a lot of thought. We need to decide how far we want to go with AI development, and we need to put safety measures in place to stop AI from being used for bad things.</li>
            <li>It makes you think and makes you ask some important questions. I hope it will make people think more about where AI is going in the future.</li>
            <li>Some of the things we could do to protect ourselves are:</li>
            <div>
                <ol>Creating rules for the creation and use of AI that are moral.</ol>
                <ol>Making foreign agreements to stop AI from being used for bad things.</ol>
                <ol>Putting money into study into how safe and secure AI can be.</ol>
                <ol>I think the movie is a good place to start talking about this. </ol>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>In addition to the things I've already said, I think it's important to think about how AI affects ethics. For example, how can we make sure AI isn't used to treat certain groups of people unfairly? How should we protect people's privacy when AI is used to get information about them and examine it?</p>
        <p>These are just a few of the many questions we need to answer as AI creation moves forward. It is a hard and complicated problem, but it is one that we can't ignore.</p>
        <p>I think it's important to take a fair approach to making AI better. We shouldn't be scared of artificial intelligence, but we should also be aware of the risks. We need to make AI in a way that is safe, does the right thing, and helps people.</p>
        <p>I have high hopes for the future of AI. AI has the ability to make the world a better place, in my opinion. But I also think that as we create AI, we need to be careful and responsible. We need to make sure that artificial intelligence is used for good and not for bad.</p>
