      <p t>The idea of "big data" is becoming more important in today's data-driven world. SAS is a well-known company that makes analytics products. Their webpage has useful information about what "big data" is, why it's important, and how it's changing the business world.</p>
      <p>The page stresses that "big data" isn't just about the amount of data, but also about how businesses use that data to make smart choices. Doug Laney's "three V's" (Volume, Velocity, and Variety) made the idea of "big data" more popular in the early 2000s. These three V's show how hard it is for companies to handle and examine the huge amounts of different kinds of data. On top of that, the page adds two more Vs: variability and veracity. Variability shows how unpredictable data flows are; they change all the time, so businesses need to keep up with trends almost in real time. Veracity emphasizes the quality of the data, which is very important because data comes from many places and is hard to connect, match, clean, and compare. The page's focus on how important big data is is one of its most interesting parts. The worth of "big data" doesn't come from how much of it there is, but from how businesses use it. When paired with high-performance analytics, big data can simplify the managing of resources, make operations more efficient, improve product development, open up new income streams, and help people make decisions based on data. The example given of how SAS data management and analytics were used by Riverside County to combine different types of health and non-health data is a great example of how big data can be used to improve care for the whole person. Care paths can be made by figuring out how different people use different services, which will eventually lead to better results for patients.</p>
      <p>The page also talks about how big data has changed different fields. The Internet of Things (IoT) and other connected devices have increased the amount of data that is being collected. This has opened up new ways for businesses of all sizes to gain insights. To use the power of big data to its fullest, we need data stars like data scientists, data engineers, and data officers. If a company wants to get the most out of its big data analytics, the five key steps listed on the page can help them do that. A big data analytics path must include creating a big data plan, finding data sources, getting, organizing, saving, and studying data, as well as making smart choices based on the data.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, the SAS site gives a full picture of big data, including its background, value, and use in real life. This shows how powerful big data can be when mixed with high-performance analytics. It has the ability to spur innovation and make decisions better in many areas. This page is full of useful information for people who want to learn more about big data and use it to its fullest potential.</p>
